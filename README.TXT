Question 1:
    Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O,
    And on that farm he had a cow, EE-I-EEI-O,
    Wih a moo moo here and a moo moo there
    Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo 
    Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O
    
    Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O,
    And on that farm he had a dog, EE-I-EEI-O,
    Wih a woof woof here and a woof woof there
    Here a woof, there a woof, everywhere a woof woof 
    Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O

Question 2:
    verse("duck", "quack");
    
Question 3:
    No, I wug.
    You wugga wug.
    I wug.
    
        When baffle is called, it prints the word "wug" with no space infront or after it. 
    Whatever follows "wug" will be on the same line since it is "print" instead of "println"
    
        When ping is called, it prints a period with no space on the same line as "wug". 
    However, since the period is printed with "println", whatever comes up next will move down 1 line. 
    
Question 4: 
            ping
            baffle
            zoop
            main
            
 Question 5:
        If baffle(); is invoked at the end of the ping method, an infinite loop between baffle and ping would
     form. When baffle is called at the end of ping, it will print "wug" then calls ping. Ping would print the
     period and calles baffle again. Baffle would run again and calls ping which leads back to baffle again. 
     Eventually Java has had enough and an error occurs.
